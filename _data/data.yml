          Polhacks is an annual three day LAN-party and game festival held by UTN. For one year my main responsibilites included educating and managing
          ~40 volunteer workers and planning, procuring, and installing the equipment nessescary for powering hundreds of computers.
          Beyond my main responsibilities associated with my role, I had to assist my committee in other tasks such as hosting dinners for
          hundreds of people, procure sponsorships, hold tournaments, and more. This taught me valuable leadership and teamworking skills.
